; The year 2000 problem

; The Y2K Bug refers to the problem faced by last cantury' society regarding the notation rollover from '99 to '00. Back then, years were mostly expressed by its last 2 digits, so, it would be confusing to differentiate 2000 and 1900. In fact, programs that relies on date parameters to properly function, should probably go nuts because of it.

; Now, about the contex, it must have been a real pain in the ass having to reread and code again all high demanding complex algos. Hence, the urgence to start explainning code as plain as it gets.
